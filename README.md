# Employee-Management-using-Flask-and-Neo4j


The task at hand is to develop an employee management system for a company using Flask, a web framework in Python, and Neo4j, a graph database. The objective is to create a robust system that facilitates efficient employee data storage, retrieval, and management.

The system will utilize Flask as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. Neo4j will be employed as the database management system to store employee-related data in a graph structure, enabling flexible relationships and efficient querying.

Through the integration of Flask and Neo4j, the employee management system will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators to add, update, and search for employee information. The system will ensure data integrity, scalability, and security, while offering a reliable solution for managing employees within the company.
